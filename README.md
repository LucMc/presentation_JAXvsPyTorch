# Presentation Code for JAXvsPyTorch
Here are some basic scripts to compare JAX/Flax to PyTorch for a simple toy example of fitting a sine curve. 
(Note I am using flax.linen which is the older flax API, feel free to use the new [flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/why.html) API)

Here is some recommended material for you to start your path to high performance Machine Learning:
